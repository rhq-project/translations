This subproject is meant to host translation files for easier exchange and collaboration. The files that go into RHQ 
releases still live on the main RHQ [git at fedorahosted][2] (see [here for coregui][3] )

Basically fork the project, start translating and then send pull requests. We will then take the updated translation 
files and put them back into the main RHQ repo.

Also small contributions matter. You can make a change!

On some of the more technical aspects (like file format and encoding) see this [wiki article][1],
which gives hints about IDE setup etc.
